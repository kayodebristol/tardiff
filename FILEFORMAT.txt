File format specification for the differences file.

HEADER
    8 bytes magic string: "tardiff0" (no terminating null character!)

Then, a sequence of instructions, each formatted as follows:
        4 bytes: S (unsigned)
        2 bytes: C (unsigned)
        2 bytes: A (unsigned)
    512*A bytes: new block data

    Interpret this as follows:
        if S == 0xffffffff and C == 0xffff and A == 0xffff:
            end of instructions has been reached

        if C >  0x7fff or A > 0x7fff:
            invalid data (higher values are reserved)

        if S == 0xffffffff:
            if C > 0: invalid data
        else:
            if C == 0: invalid data
            else: copy blocks with index S through S+C (exclusive) to output

        if A > 0:
            copy extra data (A blocks) to output

FOOTER
    16 bytes: MD5 digest of the resulting output file
