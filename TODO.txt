New tool: tardiffmerge
  - WIP

New tool: tardiffinfo
  - Display information about given files and patches by computing hash codes
    and figuring out how they can be combined to reconstruct existing files,
    so a user can figure out which files and patches work together without
    explicitly trying patching (and without looking up MD5 checksums in the diff
    files).

    Effectively, files form a graph, where tar files are nodes represented by
    their MD5 digests, and patches are directed edges. The tardiffinfo tool
    should display the graph and report on patches that are unreachable from
    any given tar files (presumably, this makes the patch useless to the user).
 

New feature:
- efficient seeking in gzip files

Merge tools into a single one (to reduce total file size), e.g.:
 tardiff <file1> <file2> <diff>  -- to dif
 tardiff [-p|--patch] <file1> <diff> -- to patch
 tardiff [-m|--merge] <diff1> .. <diffN> <diff> -- to merge
