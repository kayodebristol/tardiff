To do:
 - document code
 - verify correct handling of large files (>4GB)
   (The theoretical file size limit is 2TB)

To fix:
tardiffinfo:
 - current used-file analysis is O(N^2) while it could be O(N log N)
 - current used-file analysis uses O(N) of stack space

Possible new features:
- add checksum to diff files so their consistency can be verified by tardiffinfo
- allow tardiffpatch to accept multiple diff files (which are then first merged)
- efficient seeking in gzip files
- support for multithreaded processing (useful for multi-core systems)
- tardiffmerge could automatically re-order arguments for the merge operation to
  make sense
